TSP - Traveling Salesman problem
Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is
the route of minimum cost that visits each city exactly once and returns to the
origin city? The cost function of the solution must be the minimization of the
longest distance between two consecutive cities.

You must provide the implementations for the following strategies:
• Exhaustive strategies
– Depth-First Search
– Least-Cost (Uniform cost) Search
• Heuristic strategy
– A* Search
For the heuristic strategy using A* algorithm, you must define your own
heuristic function and its implementation.
